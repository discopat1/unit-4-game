# unit-4-game
This is a game based on the concept of "crystal collector."
I used html, css, and javascript to create the project.
It is a musical theme although I did not add any musical sounds. That may change further on down the road...
The game is played by clicking on any one of the notes which are randomly assigned numerical values.
The game is won when the player reaches the exact number at the top of the screen.
The game is lost if the player exceeds the number at the top of the screen.
